# Get_image_API_google_custom_search
 
This Python script uses the Google Custom Search API to search for images based on product codes listed in an Excel file. By loading environment variables from a .env file, the script searches for relevant images and downloads them to a specified folder. Search results and file paths are saved in an Excel file for future reference. The script includes functions for cleaning file names, checking images for watermarks or inscriptions, and handling API errors.
